## Computational Thinking group at CEN

### (Computational Thinking lab @ CEN)

Centre for Excellence in Computational Engineering and Networking ([CEN](https://www.amrita.edu/center/computational-engineering-and-networking))

[Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/).

Computational Thinking group at CEN aims to develop block based programming tools to impart computational thinking for K-12 education. We constantly working on development of block based programming tools and the associated project activities and its documentation in all Indian languages.
